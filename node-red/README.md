## Node Red Integrations

## MQTT
- Here, I used the native MQTT connector to publish messages to my MQTT broker (In this case, HiveMQ)

## InfluxDB
- For InfluxDB integrations, you can integrate via Telegraf and stream the MQTT messages in via Telegraf and parse to InfluxDB (This does not require anything on the Node Red side)
- You can also write data from Node-Red to InfluxDB via the REST API or via the InfluxDB Node-Red Modules. linked below:
